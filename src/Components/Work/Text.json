I would like to clarify something here that the words visa and zairyu shikaku (zàiliùzīgé) have two different meanings. That is, a visa is a permit issued by the Japanese government to enter this country. Zairyu Shikaku is a permit issued to stay in this country for a specific purpose. First we need to understand these two. Currently, there are 3 types of visas that are common among people living in Japan."
