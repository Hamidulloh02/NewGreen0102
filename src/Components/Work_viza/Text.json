Although there are citizens of several countries who are exempt from holding a Japan Visa , the exemption only applies to those entering as tourists, as short-term visitors and business people, or other recreational purposes.For long-term stays (work, studying, family reunion), everyone needs to get the appropriate Japan Visa."
